										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="ember674" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">At OXOS, the challenge of navigating a sea of documentation is a familiar one for every team, especially the software team. Brand documents, guidelines, and industry regulations are to be considered in every step. <a id="ember675" class="ember-view" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rtmcardle/">Ryan McArdle</a>, a Machine Learning Engineer at OXOS, sheds light on how he’s transforming the approach to documentation management by implementing AI. When questions are answered faster and with increasing reliability, time is saved and operations are optimized.</p>
<p id="ember676" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><strong>The Need for Innovation</strong></p>
<p id="ember677" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">&#8220;We have so much documentation that we need to understand to do our jobs well, from design specifications to FDA regulations. Just keeping track of where all of this information is, let alone what it says, can be a full-time job,&#8221; Ryan explains.</p>
<p id="ember678" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><strong>Introducing RAG and LLM</strong></p>
<p id="ember679" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">To tackle this challenge, OXOS is leveraging advanced AI techniques. Ryan shares, &#8220;We are creating a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to use the power of a large language model (LLM) to manage the wealth of information contained in our documentation.&#8221;</p>
<p id="ember680" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<p id="ember681" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Ryan elaborates on the system&#8217;s functionality: &#8220;The retriever finds the relevant documents that a user needs information from, and the language model/chatbot uses these documents to inform a response to the user’s questions.&#8221;</p>

<p id="ember683" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><strong>Benefits for OXOS</strong></p>
<p id="ember684" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Ryan highlights the advantages for the team, &#8220;This helps us quickly sort through a sea of documents to find the information that we need when we need it, all with a natural language user interface.&#8221;</p>
<p id="ember685" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><strong>Current Implementation and Future Plans</strong></p>
<p id="ember686" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">While the system is currently focused on the software team, Ryan discusses the potential for expansion: &#8220;The goal is to get the full wealth of our documents available with this tool. For now, it’ll stay with just software for small-scale testing, ironing out intricacies before expanding.&#8221;</p>
<p id="ember687" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><strong>Ensuring Accuracy and Relevance</strong></p>
<p id="ember688" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Ryan addresses the challenge of maintaining up-to-date and accurate information: &#8220;It&#8217;s really hard when you&#8217;re working in this industry to verify that everything is good to go – because accuracy is an absolute must.&#8221; The system&#8217;s ability to prioritize and understand revisions is crucial for ensuring reliability.</p>
<p id="ember689" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">He explains this is what they&#8217;re looking into currently, “If you&#8217;re giving conflicting documents, say like revision A through G, and you&#8217;re not giving it a way of understanding that revision G is more important than revision A – that will be an issue. What we’re testing right now is having the system recognize the newer, prioritized versions.”</p>
<p id="ember690" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
<p id="ember691" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Ryan outlines the current status: &#8220;We have a small framework in place, but we&#8217;re continuously testing and refining based on user feedback. Building something robust starts with small-scale testing.&#8221;</p>
<p id="ember692" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><strong>A Glimpse into the Future</strong></p>
<p id="ember693" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">He concludes with a glimpse into the future: &#8220;We&#8217;re also developing a knowledge graph to handle structured data, enhancing our capabilities even further.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="ember1846" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__heading-3">Global Access Limitations</h3>
<p id="ember1847" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">In a world where medical technology is constantly evolving, it&#8217;s easy to assume that most people have access to essential diagnostic care like X-rays. However, a statistic from the <a class="app-aware-link " href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/world-health-organization/" data-test-app-aware-link="">World Health Organization</a> reveals a harsh reality: two-thirds of the global population lacks access to imaging technologies(<a class="app-aware-link " href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10367423/" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-test-app-aware-link="">1</a>). This revelation not only sheds light on a critical disparity in healthcare but also underscores the urgent need for change.</p>
<p id="ember1848" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Certain regions lack more access than others. In <a class="app-aware-link " href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/forbes-magazine/" data-test-app-aware-link="">Forbes</a>, <a id="ember1849" class="ember-view" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahmoudbarakat2018/">Mahmoud Barakat</a>, Associate CEO at <a class="app-aware-link " href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/rology/" data-test-app-aware-link="">Rology</a>, highlights the vast problem in Kenya:</p>
<p id="ember1850" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__blockquote">&#8220;(There&#8217;s) 200 radiologists available to serve a staggering 3,020 hospitals, and the disparity is even more pronounced in rural areas, where 72.5% of the population resides&#8221;(<a class="app-aware-link " href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewwight/2024/02/14/how-can-ai-help-more-people-access-radiology-in-kenya-and-egypt/?sh=2964ace211f9" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-test-app-aware-link="">2</a>).</p>
<p id="ember1851" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">With the scarcity of healthcare providers, there&#8217;s a bottleneck in patient care. Addressing this issue requires empowering existing medical professionals to increase their capacity.</p>
<p id="ember1852" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><strong>What&#8217;s one way to do this?</strong> By providing heightened access to advanced imaging equipment and digital tools.</p>
<hr class="reader-content-blocks__horizontal-rule" />
<p id="ember1853" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Backed by a study from <a class="app-aware-link " href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/public-library-of-science/" data-test-app-aware-link="">PLOS </a>Global Public Health, here’s why we can&#8217;t wait any longer to enact this change:</p>
<p id="ember1854" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><strong>Delayed or missed diagnoses:</strong>Without proper imaging, early injury care becomes a challenge. This can lead to delayed diagnoses, missed opportunities for quick intervention, and potentially worse health outcomes.</p>
<p id="ember1855" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><strong>Unequal access to life-changing care:</strong> The current disparity creates a situation where the availability of medical services is heavily influenced by geographical location, further widening the gap in healthcare equity. (<a class="app-aware-link " href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0001951" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-test-app-aware-link="">3</a>)</p>
<p id="ember1856" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Improving access to diagnostic imaging in regions like Kenya is not just a matter of convenience, it&#8217;s a critical step towards ensuring equitable access to healthcare and overall health outcomes for entire populations.</p>
<hr class="reader-content-blocks__horizontal-rule" />
<h3 id="ember1857" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__heading-3">Where OXOS Comes In</h3>
<p id="ember1858" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">OXOS’ goal is to empower earlier and more accurate diagnoses through expanded X-ray access for patients and healthcare professionals.</p>
<p id="ember1859" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">By improving efficiency and effectiveness of our imaging technology, we can lessen the X-ray accessibility gap. Traditional X-ray machines can be bulky and require specialized infrastructure, making them impractical for many settings, especially in low-resource areas. However, advancements like portable and handheld X-ray devices offer a game-changing solution. These versatile X-ray machines can be deployed in diverse or remote settings, enabling providers to deliver prompt and comprehensive care at the point of need.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="ember1861" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__heading-3">Further Advancements</h3>
<p id="ember1862" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms into X-ray technology can improve processes and accuracy. Existing AI improves workflow, while future developments like Noise to Noise blur reduction can promise even better image quality. Harnessing the power of these digital tools can enhance the ability to analyze images rapidly and accurately. Professionals can expedite diagnoses, reduce human error, and optimize treatment plans. The synergy between AI and X-ray has the potential to change the industry for years to come.</p>
<p id="ember1864" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph">The revelation that two-thirds of the world lacks access to X-ray diagnostics is a reminder of the inequalities in global healthcare. However, companies like OXOS can change this statistic. Through advancements in technology, collaboration, and advocacy, we can empower medical professionals worldwide to deliver quality care and improve health outcomes like never before. It&#8217;s time to make access a universal reality.</p>

<p>With over <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/medical-imaging-systems-market">$47 billion</a> spent annually on medical imaging by 2030, OXOS is uniquely positioned to capture a significant portion of this growing market. OXOS technology overcomes the significant challenges associated with expensive and complex X-ray technologies while addressing the increasing global shortage of radiology resources.</p>
<h3><strong>Growing Shortage of Radiology Resources Across the Globe</strong></h3>
<p>The demand for radiology services has steadily risen since 2013. <a href="https://jacksoncoker.com/radiologist-shortage/#:~:text=Nearly%20half%20of%20the%20Radiologists,in%20the%20tens%20of%20thousands">Nearly half of the radiologists</a> in the U.S. are of retirement age, and fewer residents are waiting to fill these soon-to-be-vacant positions, leaving the 2025 projected shortage in the tens of thousands. The staffing shortage is even more acute among radiation technologists. In the U.K., <a href="https://radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-management/healthcare-economics/uk-experiencing-desperate-shortage-radiologists">97% of radiology departments</a> cannot meet diagnostic reporting requirements, leaving patients waiting a month or more for their imaging results. OXOS addresses this hospital-driven bottleneck by deploying technology that can be used in diverse environments by users with varying levels of training.</p>
<h3><strong>OXOS Smart and Safe Radiation Technology</strong></h3>
<p>Traditional radiology solutions are well known for their limitations in image quality and high radiation exposure. With an incredibly low radiation profile, OXOS devices change the status quo, providing exceptional image sharpness and clarity in the smallest form factor, making X-ray more accessible.</p>
<p>OXOS combines advanced image processing, computer vision, X-ray detector improvements, easy ergonomics, and innovative X-ray tube architecture to deliver safer devices, while significantly reducing radiation exposure. OXOS developed the only devices on the market that can provide both static images (digital radiography) and live imaging (dynamic digital radiography), for both diagnostic and surgical radiography, in any setting.</p>
<p>OXOS devices connect directly to the <a href="https://oxos.com/oxos-medical-launches-cloud-platform-to-streamline-radiographic-workflow-from-order-to-outcome/">OXOS Cloud Platform</a>, allowing physicians to instantly access radiographic studies from anywhere on any device. The platform redefines expectations for seamless care and delivers improved access and efficiency for patients and providers. Fully HIPAA-compliant, the OXOS cloud platform seamlessly integrates with existing radiology infrastructure or can leverage OXOS’ nationwide teleradiology service to provide study interpretation in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>“We are beyond thrilled to be co-leading the OXOS Series A. We believe OXOS will have the same transformational impact on radiology as the iPhone had on mobile computing,” shared Gregg Hill, Parkway Venture Capital managing partner. “Their unique 3D imaging technology, coupled with Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence, makes OXOS devices easy to use. OXOS automatically selects appropriate doses, minimizing reshoots and reducing radiation overexposure. Combined with its maximum portability and wireless connectivity, OXOS is the future of radiology across all care scenarios.”</p>
<p>“Intel Capital is excited to support OXOS,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arun-chetty/">Arun Chetty</a>, Managing Director, Intel Capital. “By combining OXOS’ advanced technology stack with Intel’s worldwide manufacturing and engineering expertise, OXOS can accelerate innovation in X-ray imaging and radiographic diagnostics.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Dr. Greg Kolovich, a Harvard-trained, board-certified orthopedic surgeon, and serial entrepreneur Evan Ruff, OXOS Medical launched its first FDA-approved device, the <a href="https://oxos.com/oxos-receives-fda-clearance-for-first-of-its-kind-ai-automated-radiation-dose-engine/">Micro C</a>®, in 2022. The device has won many orthopedic customers, spanning the VA, urgent care facilities, NFL teams, and medical education customers. Under its Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the VA, the OXOS team works closely with radiologist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/beth-ripley-1281a494/">Dr. Beth Ripley</a>, Deputy Chief, Office of Healthcare Innovation and Learning at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Dr. Ripley and OXOS are increasing access to radiographic care by deploying OXOS solutions to multiple care settings for U.S. veterans.</p>
<p>“VA Ventures is invested in exploring how we can move care outside of the hospital walls,” says Dr. Ripley. “Our goal is to shift care from urban centers to VA’s 1,074 community-based outpatient centers (CBOCs), providing the soonest and best care to Veterans. OXOS and the VA are testing the feasibility of providing radiologic diagnostics at the point of care. We are excited to continue down this pathway as the next step in the evolution of care delivery here in VHA.”</p>

<h3>AiLARA determines the appropriate x-ray settings to minimize radiation exposure for high-quality, low dosage diagnostic images.</h3>
<p>ATLANTA—(March 10, 2022)—OXOS Medical, the rising MedTech company creating radiographic diagnostic tools, announced FDA clearance of its AiLARA System. This system automates the implementation of the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle for OXOS’s portable X-ray unit, the Micro C. AiLARA makes it simple to take very low-dose X-ray images, reduce reshoots, maintain image quality, and streamline patient care. Operators and patients can trust that their radiation exposure is low and safe with AiLARA.</p>
<p>ALARA serves as the guiding radiation safety principle, stating that an operator should always seek to select the lowest radiation level possible to generate a clinically relevant image. In radiographic imaging, Clinicians can practice the ALARA principle by adjusting the settings and positioning the x-ray source to reduce the radiation exposure to the patient and operator. However, this is a subjective task for the operating clinician, requiring both skill and experience.</p>

</div>
<div class="text__box">
<h3>The Micro C being used for a hand X-ray</h3>
<p>AiLARA is the world’s first AI-powered, automated, dynamic radiation dose engine. The system implements ALARA in the Micro C family of instruments, automatically selecting a low dose. AiLARA utilizes OXOS’s patented positioning system to determine the thickness of the anatomy, the distance from the x-ray source, and the distance from the detector.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="text__section">
<p>A machine-learning algorithm then determines the appropriate X-ray settings, namely the X-ray tube voltage potential (kV), the beam current (mA), and the exposure time (ms). This process results in a clinically relevant X-ray image using the smallest radiation dose possible while maintaining OXOS’s industry-leading image quality.</p>
<p>“This is analogous to using the “auto” setting on a digital camera, enabling operators to use the Micro C in a point-and-shoot capacity—an industry-first for radiographic systems,” says Gage Carr, Image Intelligence Lead at OXOS Medical.</p>
<p>Diagnostic imaging is essential to modern healthcare, and maintaining safety with low-dose X-rays is critical. AiLARA makes it easy for any clinician, not just radiation technologists, to create quality X-ray images safely.<br />
This FDA clearance contributes to a momentous first quarter for OXOS. The USPTO recently granted a <a href="https://oxos.com/oxos-medical-scores-us-patent-for-rolling-collimator-opening-access-to-micro-c-x-ray-imaging-system/">US patent</a> to OXOS for their novel rolling collimator. These recent successes highlight how OXOS improves the Micro C x-ray system and strives to produce radiographic technology accessible to anyone, anywhere. Customers using the Micro C will significantly benefit from these innovative advancements that directly put the future of accessible, low dosage x-rays into their hands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Integrated offering provides reliable bone age assessments quickly, speeding diagnostic decision-making for pediatric patients.</h3>
<p><a href="https://oxos.com/">OXOS Medical</a>, inventor of the Micro C – the world’s first handheld dynamic digital x-ray device, is proud to announce the integration of ImageBiopsy Lab’s PANDA Pediatric Bone Algorithm for Diagnostic MSK Imaging to assist in the assessment of bone age for pediatric patients at the point of care. This integration automates and accelerates the highly subjective and time-consuming method, the Greulich &amp; Pyle Atlas assessment.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.imagebiopsy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IB Lab</a> is at the forefront of radiographic artificial intelligence, and we are excited to be part of their deployment,” says Evan Ruff, CEO of OXOS Medical. “By integrating directly with OXOS, bone age assessments are embedded in the pediatric patient workflow, as opposed to adding a time consuming and expensive step in traditional care scenarios.” Philip Meier, CCO, and Co-founder of IBL, states, “Bone age assessment is a natural fit for IB Lab’s machine learning expertise. X-ray bone age estimates are an ideal problem for computational automation, and IB Lab is excited to expand access to this technology.”</p>
<p>In pediatric orthopedics, the determination of bone age is critical to the success of the intervention. The child’s predicted bone age guides the specific course of treatment, informing determinations around internal or external fixation, casting and bracing, and other associated procedures.</p>
<p>“When working with pediatric patients, I’m always concerned about their growth trajectory and protecting the patient from excess radiation as much as possible,” says Dr. Greg Kolovich, Orthopedic Surgeon and Co-founder of OXOS Medical. “With PANDA available right at the point of care, it’s as simple as a click of the x-ray, and I have the information I need. All this in the exam room, with the parent present, without having to send the child to the ‘scary’ x-ray suite.”</p>
<p>IB Lab PANDA uses deep learning technology to report bone age based on the Greulich &amp; Pyle scale and provides automated results within 5 seconds. IB Lab PANDA’s automated bone age estimates are accurate within 5.4 months.</p>
<p>The combination of cutting-edge artificial intelligence and low-dose, point of care x-ray allow providers to apply the latest international medical standards to enable timely and accurate decision making. IB Lab and OXOS look forward to delivering a full suite of Radiographic AI Algorithms to make radiographic diagnostics available to anyone, anywhere, to improve patient care and access to radiographic diagnostics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://oxos.com/">OXOS Medical</a>, a medtech spin-off out of Georgia Tech, has created the Micro C, an FDA cleared handheld X-ray system that is designed to image the distal extremities, from the shoulder to the hand and from the knee to the foot. The device is intended to prevent situations in which clinicians have to handle and operate large machinery to perform simple X-ray imaging of small bones in the extremities, and allows them to conduct imaging right at the point of care.</p>
<p>The device can be deployed during surgical procedures, and allows surgeons to more easily capture images that could be difficult to obtain using large, fixed equipment. The small size and portable nature of the system may also help to increase access to medical imaging in low-resource and remote areas of the world.</p>
<p>OXOS reports that the device emits very low levels of radiation compared with traditional X-ray systems. This means that the Micro C can be used for dynamic digital radiography, meaning that it can produce ‘X-ray videos’, allowing clinicians to perform guided injections or study bones in motion.</p>
<p><em>Medgadget </em>had the opportunity to speak with the OXOS Medical co-founders, Evan Ruff, CEO, and Gregory Kolovich, Chief Medical Officer, about the technology.</p>
